# Lab1
Create a relational database schema that allows you to store data
about a set of exercises that a coach can give in a gym
for the visitor of the hall (the latter must be registered in the system),
sets of exercises grouped into default programs. Trace
keep in mind that different programs may run on different days, and
also that one coach can have many wards as well
wards can change the coach
When saving exercises you should also save the date when the coach
assigned a program and how long these exercises should be performed. For
each exercise can be provided with the duration of its implementation
(for example - exercises on a dam, 5 minutes), the number of times
(50 squats), or other criteria (for example - dam exercises, 2000
m / or 40 calories)
